By the last 2024 meeting on December 18, there is a 50% probability that the funds range will be 4.00%-4.25% and a 32% chance the target will be 4.25%-4.50%. Treasury yields across the curve ticked higher, mostly in the five- and 10-year yields, which rose 30 to 40 bps. Market yields have been falling since April in anticipation of a slowing economy and the rate.   We are now in the last half of September, and the next two weeks historically are the worst of the year for stocks. Did we front-load those losses during the first four trading days of the month or does the market have pain ahead? Short term, it's hard to get a good feel for what will play out. But we feel confident that the fourth quarter will be kind to investors. The last quarter of the year, especially the months of November and December, are typically two of the strongest months of the year.   The other nagging question (and keeping in mind that there are multiple economic reports ahead, 3Q EPS reports in October, and a presidential election in November) is the following. What will lead the market into the end of the year? Over the past three months, leadership has come from Real Estate, Utilities, Financial, Consumer Staples, Industrials, Healthcare, and Consumer Discretionary. That is a broad group.

The oil chart is a mess, with prices chopping around from the low $60s to the mid-$90s since the summer of 2022. Other sector strength was seen from the defensive Staples and Utilities groups, with minor gains in Materials, Financials, and Communication Services.   A fair amount of people in the financial world have said that the S&P 500\\'s almost full recovery from the pullback in the second half of July into early August has been too fast.

Form 13Fs, which institutions must file to report their holdings, are due 45 days after the end of calendar quarters and have come in for 2Q24. We review 13Fs of major institutional investors, including activists, to see what they are buying and to look for trends. Activist investing is now less about generating a short-term return and more about achieving long-term returns through an active management/investor partnership. The stock-market volatility during 2Q gave those institutional investors a chance to buy a dip. Taking a look at the 13Fs from well-known institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy, either adding new holdings or increasing existing holdings. Buying was across a variety of sectors. Based on Vickers data, the following are select purchases made in 2Q by some high-profile money managers.

After three down days, that was enough for the \"king of the hill\" and investors swooped in and catapulted Nvidia (NVDA) to a 6.7% pop on June 25. The stock is now just 7% from its recent all-time closing high. While other semiconductor stocks rose as well, their gains were muted -- with most of the heavyweights gaining 2%-3%. ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) was the exception, reclaiming 6.4%.   So was that it for the great semiconductor decline in 2024? Bullishly, most of the big stocks held initial support from their 21-day exponential averages. In addition, the semis quickly worked off extreme momentum divergences on a daily basis. But many remain overbought on a weekly basis and have traced out weekly bearish divergences (some quite glaring). From a technical basis, we would prefer (and lean toward) more sideways-to-down price action in the coming weeks before the next leg higher. Seasonally, the summer-to-fall period has been the worst for semiconductors and technology in general.     As for the areas of the market that had benefited recently, June 25 was not a pretty day. The S&P MidCap 400 declined 1%, while the S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.9%.

It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, even during the pandemic, has expanded to record levels. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, the domestic economy would not be growing and capital would not be flooding into the country. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $23 trillion at the end of 1H21. That's growth of 23-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than three-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven, in large part, by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2020 was approximately $41 trillion, according to SIFMA, representing 38% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 26% of global GDP. The current low level of interest rates and the relatively high level of the dollar both attest to the confidence that global investors have in the innovative U.S. economy.\"}, {'id': '2660_Analyst Report_1634625336000', 'title': 'Analyst Report: Apple Inc', 'provider': 'Argus Research', 'publishedOn': '2021-10-19T06:35:36Z', 'summary': 'Apple manufactures smartphones, tablets, P6Cs, software and peripherals for a worldwide customer base.

After three down days, that was enough for the \"king of the hill\" and investors swooped in and catapulted Nvidia (NVDA) to a 6.7% pop on June 25.

Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all businesses that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as workers\\' rights, poverty, hunger, and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, and community. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We built our portfolio by identifying companies that are BUY-rated by Argus analysts and also score well on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST Capital\\'s mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public.

       "[\"The Federal Reserve cut the fed funds rate by 50 basis points (bps), energizing buyers for about 45 minutes yesterday. Then, as often happens, investors faded the first move, stocks were lower into the close, and currently the futures market is through the roof. End of day, the Fed's target is now 4.75%-5.25%. By the last 2024 meeting on December 18, there is a 50% probability that the funds range will be 4.00%-4.25% and a 32% chance the target will be 4.25%-4.50%. Treasury yields across the curve ticked higher, mostly in the five- and 10-year yields, which rose 30 to 40 bps. Market yields have been falling since April in anticipation of a slowing economy and the rate.   We are now in the last half of September, and the next two weeks historically are the worst of the year for stocks. Did we front-load those losses during the first four trading days of the month or does the market have pain ahead? Short term, it's hard to get a good feel for what will play out. But we feel confident that the fourth quarter will be kind to investors. The last quarter of the year, especially the months of November and December, are typically two of the strongest months of the year.   The other nagging question (and keeping in mind that there are multiple economic reports ahead, 3Q EPS reports in October, and a presidential election in November) is the following. What will lead the market into the end of the year? Over the past three months, leadership has come from Real Estate, Utilities, Financial, Consumer Staples, Industrials, Healthcare, and Consumer Discretionary. That is a broad group. Information Technology is the only sector that has been down over the past three months. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)\"]"
